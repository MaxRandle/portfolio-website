          This application is being hosted by a Node webserver running Express.js!
          <br />
          <br />I have used NodeJS for many project including this one such as building simple webservers and REST
          API's. I have also become familiar with ExpressJS and MongoDB which when used together is a popular stack for
          building lightweight web applications. My usage of these technologies was to expand the functionality of an
          existing API by building a server which would retrieve data from the API every 2 hours and then store the data
          in a database. I then added some endpoints so that the data could be requested in a wider variaty of ways and
          in a more useful format.
