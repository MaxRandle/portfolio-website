          AI in all forms has always interested me. I like implementing clever algorithms and here I have an example of
          an algorithm that can outperform humans at the game of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe!

              The game of UTTT (Ultimate Tic Tac Toe) presents interesting challenges for both humans and machines to
              play. The main challenge facing both humans and machines is that its very difficult to look at a given
              board state and work out which player has an advantage overall. Even at the highest level of play, humans
              tend to play without any well defined strategy and experts might not be able to tell you who has the upper
              hand in a match. Basically, this game is hard.
              <br />
              <br />
              So the greatest challenge is coming up with a static evaluation function. This is a function that takes
              the current state of the game as an input, and returns a number between 1 and -1, 1 meaning certain
              victory for player1 and -1 meaning certain defeat for player1. For a game like chess we can come up with a
              crude static evaluation function by adding up the pieces in play for each player. But for UTTT, no such
              function is known. So instead we have to resort to using something called monte-carlo tree search. This
              algorithm essentially plays out the remainer of moves in the game totally at random until the game is
              over. The outcome of each itteration is recorded and at the end, The score is calculated by player1 wins -
              player2 wins divided by the number of itterations.
              <br />
              <br />
              The next challenge faced was coming up with moves that lead to advantageous board states as evaluated by
              monte-carlo tree search. First we generate a tree of board states that are able to be legally reached in 5
              moves (depth=5). Then the leaf nodes are evaluated with monte-carlo, the evaluations are then propogated
              up the tree until we reach the root node and the scores for each move at depth=1 are compared. This
              algorithm is called the minimax algorithm,{" "}

                this YouTube video
              </Link>{" "}
              does a fantastic job of explaining how it works.
              <br />
              <br />
              Unfortunately the minimax algorithm is an exhaustive search approach, meaning it explores every possible
              branch of the tree, even ones that should be unreachable due to the opponent never allowing such a move.
              This is a pretty computationally expensive algorithm O(n^m) where m is branching factor and n is depth.
              looking 5 moves deep could easily lead to evaluating 200,000+ board states. So what can we do? We want
              this to run on a server with specs I can afford. This is the last challenge faced. Luckily, there are a
              few tricks at our disposal.
              <br />
              <br />
              The first thing we can do is to implement something called alpha-beta pruning. This basically eliminates
              branches of the search tree that cannot be reached due to the opponent taking a more advantageous move
              earlier on in the tree. The pruning effect can be maximized by caring about the order in which board
              states are evaluated. Moves that are likely to be good moves at first glance should be evaluated first.
              The second thing we can do is to implement something called progressive deepening which searches deeper
              into more promising lines of play instead of just a flat depth of 5 moves. In the current incarnation of
              the AI, I have implemented alpha-beta pruning but not progressive deepening, I'll save that one for later.
